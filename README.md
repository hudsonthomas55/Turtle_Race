Two Player Turtle Race Game

I got the idea for this game from a moderate-advanced python blog teaching coders like me.

This game is played by each of two players pressing 'Enter' which rolls a die.
The number of steps is the die roll times twenty.
Once one player reaches the middle part of the 'turtle home' they win.


Fun fact:
I named Sheldon as I believe this is a good name for a turtle, and my wife jokingly named the second turtle after me. I found it funny and decided to roll with it.
